You Are Not Google is an article by Bradfield School of Computer Science. It's my favorite article because it  highlights a pit that a lot of software engineers fall into at some stage in their development. That pit being the tendency for the developers to want to design systems with the same level of complexity as those used by tech giants like Google. 

This process usually comes with over-engineering solutions by imitating the architectures of massive companies. The article emphasizes that most applications don't require the same level of scalability or complexity as Google, Facebook, or Amazon. Instead, it advocates for simplicity, maintaining focus on the actual needs of your project and its users.

One particularly valuable point is the discussion of trade-offs. The article reminds developers to carefully assess whether the cost of implementing complex systems (like distributed databases or microservices) outweighs the benefits for their specific use case. 

I see this perspective to be especially important for startups or small teams, where resources and time are limited.

## Peer Review by Event
I found this article particularly interesting as we are all Computer Science students with the dream of creating something of our own in the near future.
